    - `Hamburger.jsx`
    - `MetricsCard.jsx`
    - `SignInCard.jsx`
  - `pages/`

App.js is the source point of the project. It is the component that renders the login page according to the Figma Design.

It makes use of the following components:
- `SignInCard`
- `MetricsCard`

At the bottom right hand corner of the source login page is a `To Repo Page` button that redirects the user to the Repositories Page.

The repositories page is a page that renders the repositories of the user. It makes use of the following components:
- `Hamburger`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
